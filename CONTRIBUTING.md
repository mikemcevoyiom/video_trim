# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! These guidelines help ensure a smooth collaboration.

## Branching Strategy
- The `main` branch holds stable code. Please create a feature branch from `main` for your work.
- Use descriptive branch names such as `feature/short-description` or `fix/issue-id`.
- Keep your branch up to date by rebasing regularly onto `main`.

## Coding Style
- Match the style of the surrounding code and prefer readability over cleverness.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation and limit lines to 100 characters where practical.
- Write descriptive commit messages in the present tense.
- Run available linters or tests before submitting your changes.

## Submitting Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure your code builds and all checks pass.
3. Commit your changes and push the branch to your fork.
4. Open a pull request against `main`, describing your changes and any relevant issues.
5. Participate in the code review process by answering questions and making requested updates.

We appreciate every contribution that helps make this project better!
